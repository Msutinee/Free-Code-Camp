<p class="timeline"><b>1910-1912</p></b>
    <p>Chanel began designing hats while living with Balsan. She became a licensed milliner in 1910 and opened a boutique at 21 rue Cambon, Paris named Chanel Modes. As this location already housed an established clothing business, Chanel sold only her millinery creations at this address. Chanel's millinery career bloomed once theatre actress Gabrielle Dorziat modelled her hats.</p>

<p class="timeline"><b>1930's</p></b>
    <p>Despite her great success, Chanel closed the doors of her salon in 1939, when France declared war on Germany. Other couturiers left the country, but Chanel endured the war in Paris, her future uncertain. Chanel found she could not idly stand by and observe the early success of Christian Dior whose "New Look" prevailed in the postwar period. Chanel set out to rescue and reinvigorate women's fashion.</p>

Following Chanel's death in 1971, several of her assistants designed the couture and ready-to-wear lines until Karl Lagerfeld took over the design in 1983 and ready to wear in 1984. Lagerfeld, like Chanel, looked to past designs for the secret to his success. His designs incorporated signature Chanel details, tweed fabrics, colours, gold chains, quilt-stitched leather and the linked "CC" logo.</p>
